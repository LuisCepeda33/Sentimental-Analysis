# Sentimental-Analysis

I've tried multiple Instagram-scrapers. The most complete solution for python is Instagram-Scraper by arc298
https://github.com/arc298/instagram-scraper

The code for extract instagram comments loojs like this (for users):
instagram-scraper <user to scrape> -u <your username> -p <your password> --comments --media-types none --maximum 80
  
The code for extract instagram comments loojs like this (for tags):
instagram-scraper <user to scrape> -u <your username> -p <your password> --tags --comments --media-types none --maximum 80

In order to access twitter Api, you'd need to request access. It took 2 days for me. Once you have the keys, change line 13.

One you have the JSON file from instagram, just change line 5 from extract_comment_tags or extract_comment_tags.



Enjoy results!
